# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Mission

geo-organizer is the authoring tool for the geo ecosystem's AI tooling: Claude Code skills, agent
definitions, and MCP servers consumed by `geo-builder`, `geo-browser`, and future geo repos. It is
an authoring tool, not a runtime dependency — artifacts are generated here, delivered into a
consumer's `.claude/` directory, and committed into that repo. From that point the consumer runs
standalone: geo-organizer does not need to exist on the same machine, and nothing here is
imported, invoked, or resolved at consumer runtime.

Skills and agents are markdown, delivered as files. MCP servers are the only executable artifact,
distributed as installable Python packages rather than path-referenced source.

A stale skill is worse than no skill — it encodes invariants that no longer hold, with the
model's confidence behind them. Keeping generated artifacts versioned with the repo they describe
(not with this one) is what keeps them from drifting out of date unnoticed.

This repo owns: skill and agent authoring, MCP server implementation, and the conventions for
deriving invariants from the producer/consumer boundary. Consumers own their `.claude/` contents
once delivered — when to update, and whether to accept a generated artifact at all.

This repo does not: execute skills or agents, read consumer source at runtime, or participate in
any consumer's build.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the distribution model, artifact types, repository layout, and
design principles.

## Template Sync

- **Source**: [croicu/tpl-py](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py)
- **Synced to**: 2026-07-30T12:00:01Z (set by `tasks/repo_setup.md` at instantiation time; left
  unset in `tpl-py`'s own master copy of this file, since the source has nothing to sync
  against)

This repo is either `tpl-py` itself or was generated from it. `tpl-py`'s `ADDENDUM.md` is a
curated, timestamped log of changes meant for downstream instances (new/changed rules,
base-module fixes, obsoleted patterns) — routine housekeeping doesn't get an entry. Which
protocol below applies depends on which repo you're in.

### Reading the addendum (applies in an instance)

1. Fetch `tpl-py`'s `ADDENDUM.md` over plain HTTPS (e.g. `WebFetch` against the raw content
   URL) — no `gh` CLI, no `git clone`, no persistent git remote required.
2. Compare each row's timestamp against this repo's `Synced to` value above.
3. For rows newer than that, fetch only that entry's individual file under `addendum/` (not the
   whole history) and decide whether/how to apply it here.
4. After applying (or deliberately skipping) everything newer, bump `Synced to` above to the
   latest entry's timestamp.

### Writing an addendum entry (applies only in `tpl-py` itself)

1. When making a change meant for downstream instances, add a new file under `addendum/`
   (filename prefixed with an ISO timestamp) describing what changed, why, and what an instance
   should do about it.
2. Append a row to `ADDENDUM.md`'s table (timestamp, title, filename).

## Cross-Repo Coordination

Not every instance needs this section — add it (or an adapted version of it) once this repo has a
real data/API contract with another repo in your ecosystem (a producer/consumer relationship, not
just "both repos happen to exist"). Same judgment call as the multi-package case in Architecture
convention 7: build this when the need is real, don't pre-build it. Retrofit is cheap — this is
process guidance, not code.

**Placement rule**: a cross-repo issue lives in whichever repo owns the actionable follow-up, not
necessarily where the need originated:
- **This repo ships a breaking or notable change** (a changed contract, a deprecated symbol, a
  schema migration) → open an issue in the consumer repo(s) announcing it, since that's where the
  reacting work happens.
- **A consumer needs something from this repo** (a new capability, a bug in what it returns) →
  open an issue here requesting it, since that's where the building work happens.

**Does a given change need one at all?** If this repo curates a public surface (Architecture
convention 8), use that boundary to decide cheaply instead of re-deriving it each time: touched
only internal implementation (not re-exported, not a documented CLI flag/file format)? No
cross-repo issue needed, *unless* the change alters externally observable behavior anyway (a bug
fix that changes what a public function returns still counts). Touched the actual public surface
(an `__init__.py` re-export, a public class's constructor/method signature, a CLI flag, a persisted
file/schema format)? Default to assuming a cross-repo issue is needed, then confirm.

**Conventions**:
- Label every cross-repo issue `cross-repo` (alongside the normal `status:*` label) so these
  threads are filterable apart from this repo's own internal work — create the label
  (`gh label create`) if it doesn't exist yet.
- Always cross-link: the issue body must reference the originating repo/issue/commit, so either
  side is navigable from the other.
- Use `gh issue create --repo <owner>/<repo>` to open a cross-repo issue directly from wherever
  you're working — no need to switch working directories first.

**Multiple consumers**: don't build a consumer registry, fan-out-on-breaking-changes, or a
rollout-tracking process ahead of a second real consumer — that's speculative process-building, the
same judgment call as the "don't build a DI factory/composition-root prematurely" note under Coding
Style. When a second consumer repo actually arrives, that's the trigger to design that extension,
not before.

## Collaboration rules

- Before implementing any feature or non-trivial change, ask clarifying questions until the intent is unambiguous.
- If anything is unclear or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask — do not assume and implement.

### Task workflow

Tasks are tracked as GitHub issues in this repo, status via labels: `status:brainstorm`,
`status:implementation`, `status:testing`, `status:ready-to-submit`, `status:ready-for-integration`
(only needed once this repo has a `cross-repo` relationship with another — see "Ready for
Integration" below). There is no `status:done` label — reaching Done means closing the issue.
(These labels don't exist on a freshly-created repo — create them with `gh label create` before
the first task needs one.)

Tasks come in two flavors, which affects whether step 1 below applies:

- **Planned tasks** — a `tasks/<task-name>.md` already exists (or is being freshly authored as a
  deliverable in its own right) before implementation discussion starts, e.g. dropped in by the
  user ahead of time. Follow all stages below, starting with Brainstorm.
- **Ad-hoc tasks** — the task emerges organically from conversation (no pre-existing or
  deliberately-authored task file). Skip straight to Implementation: no `tasks/<task-name>.md` gets
  created at all, just open the GitHub issue directly once the discussion has converged. Don't
  create a task file first just to immediately trim/delete it — that's churn, not documentation.

For any non-trivial feature or change, follow these stages:

1. **Brainstorm** (planned tasks only) — copy `tasks/new_task.md` to `tasks/<task-name>.md` with the problem statement; update it with conclusions as the design discussion progresses. This is scratch space for live back-and-forth — an issue isn't required at this stage, but a lightweight tracking issue labeled `status:brainstorm` can be opened for backlog visibility if wanted; either way, `tasks/<task-name>.md` (not the issue) stays the working document until the design converges.
2. **Implementation** — open a GitHub issue (`gh issue create`) with the converged problem statement + conclusions as the body, labeled `status:implementation`. Write the code. For a planned task, `tasks/<task-name>.md` is no longer the source of truth once the issue exists — trim it to a one-line pointer at the issue (or delete it) rather than maintaining both. For an ad-hoc task, there's no file to trim — the issue was the first artifact.
3. **Testing** — relabel the issue `status:testing`. Verify correctness; post test results and any open issues as an issue comment. **For a `cross-repo` issue that originated from a consumer repo's own testing/diagnosis**, this repo's own verification — even a live check against a real external dependency — confirms the fix works in isolation, but isn't the same as confirming the originally reported symptom is actually resolved: that requires the consumer to pull the updated code and re-test in its own context. Say so explicitly in the comment rather than implying it's fully confirmed.
4. **Ready to Submit** — relabel `status:ready-to-submit`. Run lint + tests; confirm docs are up to date; post a summary comment. This is as far as *this* repo's own work can confirm the issue.
5. **Ready for Integration** (`cross-repo` issues that need consumer-side verification only — see
   "Who closes an issue" below for which issues that is) — once the fix is actually merged/pushed,
   relabel `status:ready-for-integration` instead of leaving it at `status:ready-to-submit`. This
   is the label that actually names the gap: this repo's own checks can confirm the fix works in
   isolation, but not that the originally reported symptom is resolved — that needs the consumer to
   pull the update and re-test in its own context. An issue with no such downstream dependency (a
   same-repo bug, nothing cross-repo) skips this stage entirely — `status:ready-to-submit` is
   already its terminal pre-close state.
6. **Done** — close the issue after merge. For a planned task, delete `tasks/<task-name>.md` once the issue is closed — the issue (body + comments) is the sole source of truth from that point on, so there's no reason to keep a stale duplicate on disk. (Only applies when a real issue holds the full history; a Done task with no issue keeps its local file.) Ad-hoc tasks have nothing to delete.

**Who closes an issue**: applies to issues opened "in the family" — by the repo owner themselves
(directly, or via a cross-repo issue from one of their own other repos) — the normal case before
this project has any external contributors. In that case, whoever opened it is the one who closes
it, not automatically whoever did the implementation work: leave it open (at
`status:ready-for-integration` once pushed, if it needed that stage; otherwise
`status:ready-to-submit`) and say so; don't close it, and don't use GitHub's auto-closing
commit-message keywords (`Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Resolves #N`) for it, since those close on push
regardless of who's supposed to have that call — use a non-closing reference instead (`Ref #N`,
`Part of #N`, `Addresses #N`). This matters most for `cross-repo` issues diagnosed from a
consumer's own testing: the opener is the one positioned to actually verify the fix in that
original context, so closing is their call, not a mechanical side effect of merging. The one
exception even within the family: an issue Claude opened itself mid-task (e.g. a
`status:implementation` issue opened while executing a planned/ad-hoc task in the same session)
can be closed directly, since Claude is the opener there.

**If an issue ever comes from a genuine external contributor** (not the repo owner or one of their
own other repos), this whole rule doesn't apply — follow normal GitHub OSS etiquette instead
(auto-close via a merged PR's `Closes #N` is fine, maintainer discretion applies). Revisit this
section if/when that actually happens; it's not a case worth designing for speculatively before a
real external contributor shows up.

## Before committing

Run these before every commit:

## Documentation rule

After any change that affects the public interface, CLI, or file formats, update the relevant docs:

- `CLAUDE.md` — commands, architecture notes
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — modules, data flow, contracts
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` — CLI signature, file format schemas

## Commands

```bash
# Install (editable, with dev deps)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run
geo-organizer

# Lint
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/

# Test
pytest
pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py::test_bar   # single test
```

## Architecture conventions

1. Internal processing uses strongly typed dataclasses.
2. `protocols.py` contains public contracts: persisted/shared data (dataclasses) *and* behavioral `Protocol`s meant for a consumer to actually implement/inject (e.g. `LoggingSink`, already scaffolded here — see the Logging section below). The distinction from `contracts.py` isn't data-vs-behavior, it's "does an external consumer implement this" vs. "does this only wire this project's own internals together": a behavioral `Protocol` belongs in `protocols.py` specifically when a host application is expected to supply its own implementation of it (most relevant once this project is consumed as a library by another project — see Architecture convention 8), not just when there's some internal data type to describe. Behavior that merely *operates on* a data contract still belongs in a dedicated entity/service layer, not on the dataclass itself. Keep any behavioral `Protocol` placed here leaf-safe (convention 9) — default parameter values like a category string should be literals, not imports from `diagnostics.py`, even where `diagnostics.py` already defines the same constant.
3. `contracts.py` contains runtime behavioral interfaces (`Protocol` classes for things like workers/executors) that wire this project's *own* internals together — never imported by external consumers, unlike `protocols.py`'s behavioral `Protocol`s above.
4. Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) must run offline. Integration tests (`tests/integration/`), if the project has them, may hit real external services — that's a deliberate scope split, not a loophole in rule 4. Note `pytest.ini`'s `testpaths = tests` runs both by default, so adding an integration suite means accepting network calls in the default `pytest` invocation unless you also gate it behind a marker.
5. Prefer explicit, readable Python over clever abstractions.
6. Prefer constructor/parameter injection over monkeypatching this project's own module internals in tests — e.g. a component that talks to the outside world (network, filesystem, clock) should take that dependency as an argument, defaulting to the real implementation, so tests can pass a fake object instead of patching a function inside the module under test. Monkeypatching is still the right tool for faking a *third-party* library's own internals (e.g. an HTTP client class you don't own) — the distinction is whether the thing being faked is your code or someone else's.
7. If a project ever grows beyond a single `src/<package_name>/` package (e.g. a shared framework package plus multiple CLI tools in one repo — an intentionally rare case, not the default shape), setuptools' src-layout automatic discovery picks up multiple packages under `src/` with no extra `[tool.setuptools]` config needed, as long as each has `__init__.py`. Don't pre-build this structure speculatively — it's here so you don't have to rediscover it if the need actually arrives. **If this repo is ever installed as a pip dependency of another project** (not just run standalone), any additional top-level package added this way needs a name specific enough not to collide with another project's own top-level package — a generic name (`shared`, `defs`, `client`, `utils`, ...) used as a *second, bare* top-level package is exactly the shape that caused a real, reproduced collision between two repos generated from this same template, each independently choosing the same generic names for their own "extra" packages (see croicu/quant-data#7: installing both into one environment made whichever installed last silently shadow the other's identically-named package entirely). Default to nesting the extra concern as a subpackage of your one namespaced package instead (`<package_name>.<subpackage>`) — only give it its own bare top-level name if it has no importable surface at all (e.g. a second console-script-only CLI in the same repo) or its own name is already specific enough to be practically collision-free.
8. **Curate a public API surface, separate from internal implementation.** Even a single-package project benefits from distinguishing "what's safe for another project to import" from "internal implementation, free to change" — don't rely on every symbol in every module being equally supported. Two mechanisms, pick based on need: **`__init__.py` re-exports** — list the actually-supported names in `__all__` and import them at the package root, so consumers write `from <package_name> import Thing` rather than reaching into a specific submodule; cheap, works even for a single-package project, and the re-export list itself documents the contract. **A private subpackage** (e.g. `<package_name>/_internal/`), if the internal implementation is substantial enough that "not in `__all__`" isn't a strong enough signal on its own — prefer this *nested* under your one namespaced package over a second bare top-level package (see rule 7's collision note); nesting also sidesteps a real circular-import failure mode documented in rule 9 below.
9. **Keep the internal dependency graph acyclic — break cycles with an abstract `Protocol`, not a runtime workaround.** If two concrete modules would otherwise need each other, introduce a `Protocol` (per rule 3's `contracts.py` convention) that one side depends on instead of the other's concrete type — this is the same seam rule 6's constructor-injection convention already creates, just framed as a graph property: depending on an abstraction instead of a concretion is what keeps the graph from looping back on itself. Verify this mechanically when it matters, not by feel: list every module's static top-level imports (`grep -E "^(from|import) " -r src/`) and confirm no module is reachable from itself by following them — a passing test suite is not proof the graph is acyclic, since import-order luck can mask a real cycle. A lazy/deferred import (e.g. a module-level `__getattr__`, PEP 562) can *mask* a cycle by moving it from import-time to call-time — that's a legitimate fallback for cases a `Protocol` genuinely can't reach (e.g. a package needing to re-export a name without owning the dependency direction), not the default fix. Reach for the `Protocol` first.

## Logging

- **Use `Logger`** (`from geo_organizer.diagnostics import Logger`) — not bare `print()`.
- **All features log success and errors** — no silent success, no swallowed errors.
- **Message length by severity**:
  - **Success (info)** — short: feature started, feature ended.
  - **Recoverable issues (warning)** — medium: enough context to understand what went wrong and why it was non-fatal.
  - **Errors (error/fatal)** — detailed: full context needed to reproduce and diagnose.
- **Level guide**:
  - `Logger.diagnostic` (`VERBOSE`) — one message per chunk of work, so a run's progress is visible and a hang is distinguishable from silence (e.g. a batch-processing loop logging one `VERBOSE` line per item it starts)
  - `Logger.info` — normal notable events (start, end, success, counts)
  - `Logger.warning` — recoverable problems (retries, skipped items)
  - `Logger.error` / `Logger.fatal` — unrecoverable failures
  - `Logger.perf(description, elapsed_seconds)` — duration markers for timing-sensitive spans
    (a network call, a slow query, anything worth measuring), always logged at `INFO` under a
    fixed category `perf` (`CATEGORY_PERF`, not the caller's choice — unlike every other `Logger`
    method). Message shape is `"duration: {elapsed:.3f}s - {description}"`. If this project is ever
    consumed as a library by another project, its own perf markers become visible to the host via
    the injectable `LoggingSink` `Protocol` (see `protocols.py` and the "Explicit DI First" rule
    under Coding Style) rather than a stdlib-`logging` bridge.
- **Categories** — every `Logger` method takes an optional `category: str = "general"`, filterable via `settings.json`'s `logCategories` (an open string, not a closed enum — `diagnostics.py` only defines `CATEGORY_GENERAL` as a starting constant). Console output is `[LEVEL][category] message`. **Effective default depends on whether `logLevel` is explicit** (see "Specific settings override generic ones on scope overlap" under Coding Style — this is that rule's origin case): if `settings.json`'s `logCategories` is left empty/absent, an explicit `logLevel` decides it outright — permissive (`verbose`/`info`/`warning`) resolves to `[]` (unfiltered), restrictive (`error`/`critical`) resolves to `["general"]` — regardless of `debug`. Only when `logLevel` is left at its implicit default does `debug` get consulted as the fallback (`debug: false` -> `["general"]`, `debug: true` -> `[]`). An explicit non-empty `logCategories` always overrides all of this outright. **`excludedCategories`** is a complementary deny-list, only in effect when the resolved `logCategories` is `[]` (the true unfiltered state) — inert against an explicit non-empty `logCategories` or the restrictive `["general"]` default.

## Coding Style

- **`protocols.py` holds public contracts, not implementations** — data (dataclasses, no methods) plus behavioral `Protocol`s meant for a consumer to implement/inject (e.g. `LoggingSink`). Either way, no concrete logic lives here — a dataclass has no behavior of its own (that lives in a separate entity/service layer), and a `Protocol`'s methods are signatures only (`...` bodies), never an implementation.
- **Explicit DI First** — when choosing between (a) integrating with an ambient/shared mechanism (stdlib `logging`, a service locator, a singleton registry) and (b) explicit constructor/parameter injection of an object matching a `Protocol`, default to (b), especially when the injected object can carry more capability through unmodified than the ambient mechanism would let you reconstruct on the other side. Concrete case: `LoggingSink` (see `protocols.py`) is an explicitly injected `Protocol`, not a bridge onto stdlib `logging.getLogger(...)` — a host's own `Logger` already has real behavior (category filtering, `excludedCategories`, level thresholds), and handing it through directly via DI preserves all of that with zero glue code, whereas a stdlib bridge would force reconstructing that behavior from `extra` fields and a logger-name convention on the consuming side. Don't assume "the idiomatic library pattern" (e.g. "real libraries use stdlib `logging`") automatically wins over this — capability-preserving DI is the default here even when a framework-level integration point already exists and would technically work.
- **Explicit over brief** — if two implementations are equivalent, choose the one that is easier to read and debug, even if it is longer.
- **No list/dict/set comprehensions** — use explicit `for` loops. Comprehensions obscure control flow and make multi-step logic harder to follow.
- **No lambdas** — use named functions or plain `for` loops. Lambdas hide intent and cannot be stepped through in a debugger.
- **Import count as SRP signal** — more than 5–10 imports in a file is a hint that the file may be doing too much. Not a hard rule, but worth pausing to consider whether responsibilities should be split.
- **Don't build a DI factory/composition-root prematurely** — the same wait-for-evidence judgment as the import-count signal applies to DI wiring. A function picking up its second or third injectable parameter (e.g. `main(argv, provider=None, settings_path=None)`) is not yet a smell; extracting a shared factory/helper from a single data point risks guessing at the wrong abstraction shape. Wait for real duplication — a second call site needing the same wiring, or a parameter list that's genuinely grown unwieldy — before extracting one.
- **Specific settings override generic ones on scope overlap** — when two configuration knobs can both influence the same outcome, the more specific/targeted one wins wherever they'd otherwise disagree, not the more generic/blanket one; the generic one only falls back into play when the specific one was left at its implicit default. Origin case: `settings.json`'s `logLevel` (a targeted verbosity control) vs. `debug` (a blanket flag) both used to influence the console log-category default, with `debug` winning outright — so setting `logLevel: "verbose"` alone did nothing, silently muted by `debug`'s separate default (see the Logging section above for the resulting behavior). Apply this whenever a new settings key's effect could overlap with an existing broader flag's — don't let a coarse toggle silently override an explicit, narrower setting the user actually configured.

## New Task

## Pending Tasks

None.

## Completed Tasks
- **Repo Setup** — instantiated from `tpl-py` as `geo-organizer`: replaced all placeholder
  tokens, renamed `src/__package_name__/` to `src/geo_organizer/`, verified
  `pip install -e ".[dev]"` / `ruff check` / `ruff format` / `pytest` / CLI run all pass clean,
  set `Synced to` to `2026-07-30T12:00:01Z`, created the `status:*` and `cross-repo` labels.
- **Backport DI-for-testability and process learnings from quant-scratch** — [issue #3](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py/issues/3)
- **Backport public-surface, acyclic-dependency, and cross-repo learnings from quant-data** —
  [issue #4](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py/issues/4). Architecture conventions 7-9 (namespace
  collision safety, curated public API surface, acyclic dependency graph) and a new opt-in
  `Cross-Repo Coordination` section. First real use of the addendum protocol (three entries under
  `addendum/`), since real instances (`quant-scratch`, `quant-data`) already exist and needed
  notifying rather than just having the base files changed underneath them.
- **Backport specific-overrides-generic settings precedence from quant-data** —
  [issue #5](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py/issues/5), sourced from
  [croicu/quant-data#16](https://github.com/croicu/quant-data/issues/16). `settings.py`'s
  category-default resolution now lets an explicit `logLevel` override the blanket `debug` flag
  outright on disagreement; `diagnostics.py`'s `_LEVEL_RANK` made public (`LEVEL_RANK`); new
  Coding Style rule ("Specific settings override generic ones on scope overlap") plus a Logging
  section rewrite, including the previously-missing `Logger.diagnostic`/`VERBOSE` entry in the
  level guide. Fourth addendum entry.
- **Backport injectable `LoggingSink` + Explicit DI First rule; `ready-for-integration` issue
  workflow from quant-data** — [issue #6](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py/issues/6), sourced from
  [croicu/quant-data#19](https://github.com/croicu/quant-data/issues/19) and
  [#20](https://github.com/croicu/quant-data/issues/20). `diagnostics.py` gained
  `Logger.perf(description, elapsed_seconds)`/`CATEGORY_PERF`; `protocols.py` gained a
  `LoggingSink(Protocol)` mirroring `DiagnosticsLogSink`'s method surface, so any instance's own
  `Logger` already satisfies it structurally, ready to inject the moment a public
  constructor/factory needs one. Architecture conventions 2/3 reworded: `protocols.py`'s scope is
  now public contracts generally (data *or* behavioral-`Protocol`s-for-injection), distinguishing
  from `contracts.py` by public-vs-private rather than data-vs-behavior. New Coding Style rule,
  "Explicit DI First" — prefer injecting a `Protocol`-typed object over bridging into an ambient
  mechanism (stdlib `logging`, a service locator) when the injected object preserves more
  capability; this was the actual reasoning behind choosing `LoggingSink` over a stdlib-`logging`
  bridge. Also: new `status:ready-for-integration` label/stage and a "Who closes an issue" rule in
  the Task workflow section — whoever opened an issue closes it (not automatically whoever
  implemented the fix), prompted by two quant-data issues that got auto-closed via `Closes #N`
  before the reporter (who'd diagnosed them from a different, consumer repo) had actually verified
  the fix end-to-end. Fifth and sixth addendum entries.
